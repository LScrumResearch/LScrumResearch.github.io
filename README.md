## LScrum Research Page

Thanks for helping us conduct our research on our Android app!  We can't do it without fantastic people like you!  This should not take a huge amount of your time, and the features are only prototypes, which means they're not completely functional.  We just want to see what you think about these features.

### Jekyll Themes
