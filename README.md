## LScrum Research Page

Thanks for helping us conduct our research on our Android app!  We can't do it without fantastic people like you!  This should not take a huge amount of your time, and the features are only prototypes, which means they're not completely functional.  We just want to see what you think about these possible features.

### Basic Concept

By the time we build all of the features, the app will be an AR (Augmented Reality) Android app where users can customize their own "space" in augmented reality.  For example, they could take a photo and overlay the previous image over their camera, almost like a filter.

### To Participate

Go to the following link on your Android phone:  [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzns0vDyd9oHTHRBQkJjOEIzRk0)


Download the apk file (the app) and click install.  After installing, you can just open the app and log in with whatever username and password you wish (anything will work) and mess around!  After messing around, if you could fill out the feedback form below, we'd really appreciate it.  Here's some stuff you can do with it:


You can take a picture.  This picture will then overlay with your camera.  It will look like this:
